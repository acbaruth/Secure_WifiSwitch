Secure Wifi-Switch


Secure Wifi-Switch is a secure web based switch for the ESP8266-2 microcontroller. It features a credential based login. A username and password are required for authentication and access to the web based switch buttons. It is designed to run on the Aliosensu Wifi-Relay board which is capable of driving a relay. There is also a version of the code which is lacking the secure web based login better suited for local, or non web facing applications. The secure portion of the code was obtained from user  “brzi” at hackster.io (link below)
The program was compiled using the Arduino IDE version 1.8.2
